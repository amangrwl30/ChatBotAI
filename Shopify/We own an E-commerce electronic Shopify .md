We own an E-commerce electronic Shopify store.

We are looking to integrate an AI chatbot into our business facebook messenger. It needs to be able to respond to customer queries by pulling information from our online store.

For example, if a customer asked "What iPhone 12 do you have in?" or "how much do you charge for an iPhone 13 screen", the chatbot would provide a list of relevant product titles and prices from our online store.

The chatbot should be able to recognise spelling and grammatical errors like "du u have any 12 in?". It also needs to recognise customers will say “any 13 in” whereas they mean “Do you have any iPhone 13 in stock?”

Customers will also message us asking how much we'll buy items for, opening hours, location, phone number and problems that they have with devices, so it needs to handle these types of queries as well.

We'd like the chatbot to be able to give responses such as:
Hi, we have these iPhone 12s currently in stock:
iPhone 12 128GB Unlocked Black (C) M23227 (£225.00)
iPhone 12 128GB Unlocked Blue (C) M23398 (£195.00)
iPhone 12 64GB Unlocked Black (A) M22907 (£265.00)
iPhone 12 64GB Unlocked Black (A) M22986 (£265.00)

We also would like to only display one product if there is duplicates - the M number above is only our individual stock number.

If the customer wishes to purchase, a link should be sent to the item they’re interested in or a link to the Shopify collection for that model. If a customer further queries the product, such as "what condition is it in?”, then tell them about our condition criteria and explain that the (a) is the condition in the product title. The grading criteria should be translated as follows: (A) tell the customer it’s like new, (B) tell the customer it’s in good condition and (C) tell the customer it’s in average condition.

When a customer queries a repair price for a device, it needs to lookup the pricing from our website, e.g iPhone 12 OLED screen replacement would be £105.

We use Shopify for our products sorted into collections and have our API keys. We have our OpenAI API key for the chat bot. We have AWS lightsail for hosting.
